# Gender-Detection-using-Keras-and-OpenCV

This project focusses on understanding human visual processing and identifying key features used to categorize between male and female and this is the basis for our classification.
The convolutional neural network (CNN) consists of several convolutional layers alternating with subsampling layers and ends with one or more fully connected layers in the standard multilayer perceptron (MLP).
A significant advantage of the CNN over conventional approaches in pattern recognition is its ability to simultaneously extract features, reduce data dimensionality, and classify in one network structure
Feature extraction and classification are performed within a single network structure through learning on data samples
Feature selection is also integrated into the training process by learning the weights held responsible for extracting features
Minimal preprocessing Required
Relatively easier to train since they have fewer parameters
